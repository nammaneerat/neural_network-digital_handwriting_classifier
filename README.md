This is a part of the Dataquest guided project. This project aims to build the model are able to classify handwriting digits. We will use the k-nearest neighbors model and also neural network with a single hidden layer and 2 hidden layers. Our goal is to examine which models provide us the higher range of accuracy scores and do not overfit the dataset.
